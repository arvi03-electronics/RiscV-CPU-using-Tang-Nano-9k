# RiscV-CPU-using-Tang-Nano-9k
This project implements a minimal RISC-V RV32I CPU core on the Tang Nano 9K FPGA using Verilog and Gowin IDE. It features basic instruction execution (ALU operations, load/store), and outputs register values (especially x10/a0) via UART, viewable in serial terminals like PuTTY.
